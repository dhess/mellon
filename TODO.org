* Implement minimum wait period for locks.

Some lock devices will have a minimum delay between state changes, to
prevent hardware damage.

* Move mock cmd to tests.

* Should there be a generic controller interface, like the one presented by ThreadedController but abstracted?

* Implement a timer-based controller that runs with constant resource requirements (i.e., does not spawn threads).
