# Mellon

*"Speak, friend, and enter."*

Mellon is a set of Haskell packages for controlling physical access
devices, such as electric strikes and other electronic locks. The set
of packages includes:

* `mellon-core`, which provides the core functionality upon which the
  other packages depend.

* `mellon-gpio`, for controlling physical access devices via GPIO.

* `mellon-web`, a web interface (with client and server bindings) for
  interacting with Mellon controllers.
